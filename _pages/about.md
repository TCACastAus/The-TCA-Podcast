The TCA Podcast is really just a few Aussie blokes having a yarn about various things of the day.

### The Name

Kyle (one of the original co-hosts) once forgot the name of the very podcast he was on, and thought it was the "TCA Cast", which is an antidepressant
he was studying at the time. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricyclic_antidepressant. Given this podcast gets millions of people through each day - the name stuck.
